Hey guys. I am currently the CTO of <a href="https://etherspot.io">Etherspot</a> and <a href="https://pillar.fi">Pillar</a>. I have held several roles in the tech sector from software engineer to CTO. I am passionate about cryptography and Solution Architecture.

Iâ€™ve been a founder of three startups. The first was a company that leveraged a patented compression algorithm to build streaming applications. The second time for Pillar/Etherspot - A multi chain smart wallet/account abstraction SDK. I have also co-founded a start called <a href="https://www.kanalabs.io">Kanalabs</a> which builds several products on the Aptos/Solana ecosystem.

I have worked on all platforms such as Unix/Solaris, Microsoft, IBM Mainframes, Tandem Mainframes and Linux. I have previously dabbled in MetaTrader 4 scripts, FIX protocol and low-latency trading programs.

I am frequently contacted for freelance consulting.
